# String Methods Practice #1
#slieds 12 -16
# Print the following text in uppercase, using the specific string method:
# "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
# sentence = "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
sentence= "Especially in electronic communications, writing in all caps is equivalent to yelling."
print(sentence.upper())

# String Methods Practice #2
# Join the following list into a string, separating each item with a space. Use the appropriate list/string method, and display the result.
# word_list = ["Simple","is","better","than","complex."]

# String Methods Practice #3
# Replace in the following sentence:
sentence3="If the implementation is hard to explain, it might be a bad idea."
print(sentence3.replace("hard","easy"))
print(sentence3.replace("bad","good"))
# the following pairs of words:
# "hard" --> "easy"
# "bad" --> "good"
# and display the sentence with both words modified.
# print((modifiedsentence=sentence3.replace.("hard","easy")).replace("bad","good"))

# #join method
word_list=["simple","is","better","than","complex."]
print(word_list)
joined_sentence =" ".join(word_list)
print(joined_sentence)

new_word_list=["apples","bannas","mango","cherry","watermelon."]
joined_sentence2 ="ðŸ’•ðŸ’•".join(new_word_list) #window semicolon
print(joined_sentence2)

#split method
sentence4= "I am a python programmer"
print(sentence4.split())#splits the sentence into a list of words
#prints out as['I'.'am','a','python','programmer']

#this method splits sentence by comma
print(sentence4.split(","))#splits sentence into a list of words using seperators
#prints out as ['I am a programmer']

print(sentence4.split("a"))#splits sentence into a list of words using seperatores
#takes out a
print(sentence4.split("p"))

#concatnation with words in python reptition 15 times
result="Repitition"*15
print(result)

#1st paragraph of declartion 
#place in in fisrt_paragraph
#replace word people with citizens 
#print
#remove all space and replace commas with empjid

# Concatenate the text "Repetition" 15 times and display the result on the screen.
# Luckily, you know that strings are multipliable and you can do this activity in a simple and elegant way.

# String Properties Practice #2
# Check if the word "beach" is not found in the following haiku. You should print the boolean.
# "Whitecaps on the bay:
# A broken signboard banging
# In the April wind."

# String Properties Practice #3
# Check the Python Documentation to find the description of the len() function. Then, display on the screen the length (in number of characters) of the word electroencephalographist.
